# The First 90 Days

Proposes a pace of goals, and competencies that a new leader should achieve; and the tools to achieve those goals and build those competencies

Scary start: "Opinions of your effectiveness begin to form surprisingly quickly, and, once formed, they’re very hard to change." So obviously one wants to start well.

Your goal in every transition is to get as rapidly as possible to the break-even point. This is the point at which you have contributed as much value to your new organization as you have consumed from it.

Transition traps:

* Sticking with what you know (and not doing new things/stopping some things that won't work)
* Falling prey to the "action imperative" — doing something, anything, before you know what
* Setting unrealistic expectations — Make sure to negotiate clear, achievable objectives!
* Attempting to do too much — and losing focus
* Coming in with "the" answer — before you learn
* Engaging in the wrong type of learning — too much technical/not enough cultural, political, so you don't have relationships and don't have support
* Neglecting horizontal relationships — peers are important stakeholders

Create virtuous cycles instead, which add momentum and drive to more success

Do the right things:

* Prepare yourself, particularly by making a mental break and being ready to start new
* Accelerate your learning, particularly with critical conversations with bosses
* Achieve alignment
* Build your team — If inheriting one, evaluate, align, mobilize members. Make needed changes.
* Create coalitions — find friends
* Keep your balance — Don't lose perspective, or become isolated
* Accelerate everyone — help those around you to complete their own transition into this new org with you at the head

"It’s a mistake to believe that you will be successful in your new job by continuing to do what you did in your previous job, only more so."

"No matter where you land, the keys to effective delegation remain much the same: you build a team of competent people whom you trust, you establish goals and metrics to monitor their progress, you translate higher-level goals into specific responsibilities for your direct reports, and you reinforce them through process."

## Moving up vs. moving laterally

When moving up:

* Rethink what you delegate
* Accept you're relying on others' expertise more
* Accept that decision-making is more political at higher levels
	* This means you need to have allies
* Reports need to communicate your vision

Either way

* What does "leadership presence" mean in your company?

## Joining a new company

"Joining a new company is akin to an organ transplant—and you’re the new organ. If you’re not thoughtful in adapting to the new situation, you could end up being attacked by the organizational immune system and rejected."

To avoid this:

* Business Orientation — what's the business
* Stakeholder Connection — who are the stakeholders, whom do I spend time building relationships with
* Alignment of Expectations — check and recheck. Make sure you know how much latitude for change you have, what resources, what mandates. What do others already expect?
* Cultural Adaptation — see the external symbols of membership in a given group. Understand the norms and patterns of acceptable behavior. Reveal the fundamental assumptions and values. Areas in which norms commonly vary are
	* Influence - How do you get support — patrons vs.peers
	* Meetings — Are decisions made in meetings or made privately and announced in meetings?
	* Execution — are people or processes more important
	* Conflict — How is conflict handled? Can you have it safely?
	* Recognition — Does the company more recognize stars or team players
	* Ends vs. Means — What are the restrictions on how you achieve results?

Checklists for these:

Business orientation checklist 
* As early as possible, get access to publicly available information about financials, products, strategy, and brands. 
* Identify additional sources of information, such as websites and analyst reports. 
* If appropriate for your level, ask the business to assemble a briefing book. I
* f possible, schedule familiarization tours of key facilities before the formal start date. 

Stakeholder connection checklist 
* Ask your boss to identify and introduce you to the key people you should connect with early on. 
* If possible, meet with some stakeholders before the formal start. 
* Take control of your calendar, and schedule early meetings with key stakeholders. 
* Be careful to focus on lateral relationships (peers, others) and not only vertical ones (boss, direct reports).

Expectations alignment checklist
* Understand and engage in business planning and performance management.
* No matter how well you think you understand what you need to do, schedule a conversation with your boss about expectations in your first week. 
* Have explicit conversations about working styles with bosses and direct reports as early as possible.

Cultural adaptation checklist 
* During recruiting, ask questions about the organization’s culture. 
* Schedule conversations with your new boss and HR to discuss work culture, and check back with them regularly. 
* Identify people inside the organization who could serve as culture interpreters. 
* After thirty days, conduct an informal 360-degree check-in with your boss and peers to gauge how adaptation is proceeding.

### Assess your vulnerabilities

You like to do some things and dislike others. Be aware of what this leaves you open for

[ ] Table 1-2 Assessment of preferences 
[ ] Table 1-3 Preferences for functions

Compensate for these by actively seeking help

You'll have to "learn to learn" again — be aware you may feel less confident or more vulnerable.
	Be aware you can get stuck in a rut of doing the things you're comfortable doing, and thus fail
	
## Accelerate Your learning

Always ask "how did we get to this point"

Folks love it when you want to learn

Begin by meeting with directs 1:1, and do the same thing each time:
* Introduce yourself
* Learn about them
* Ask them these questions:
	* What are the biggest challenges the organization is facing (or will face in the near future)? 
	* Why is the organization facing (or going to face) these challenges? 
	* What are the most promising unexploited opportunities for growth? What would need to happen for the organization to exploit the potential of these opportunities? 
	* If you were me, what would you focus attention on?
* Compare answers
* See who:
	* Takes responsibility
	* Keeps quiet
	* Points Fingers
	* Has a broad view

Learning should be a top goal for the first 30 days
Make sure to collect information; analyze it; develop and test hypotheses; and then dig deeper based upon these, to create a positive cycle

## Match Strategy to Situation

* What kind of change am I called upon to make?
* What kind of change leader am I? (See table 3-1 p.63, complete table 3-2 p.68)
	* Startup — assemble capabilities
	* Turnaround - ready, fire, aim
	* Accelerated Growth - structures, processes, systems to scale up
	* Realignment - revitalize, prevent gathering clouds from leading to a storm
	* Sustaining Success - understand what has led to success; add discipline

## Negotiate Success

* Start out by negotiating
	* Expectations
	* Resources

STARS:
* Startups — need resources, protection from interference
* Turnarounds — cut business to defensible core
* Accelerated growth — secure investment
* Realignment — help making case for change
* Sustaining Success — avoid early mistakes and learn fast

Get on the boss's calendar regularly
No surprises
Share successes!
Problems? Approach with possible solutions or approaches
Learn your boss's style
Use 1:1s with boss to talk about high-leverage items
Clarify expectations and return to those to compare with status
You must make the relationship work
Set timelines to both get time to learn and force action
Identify some spots the boss cares about and get early wins
Make sure your boss's colleagues get a good impression
Identify the untouchables
Underpromise, overdeliver


Have these 5 meetings:
* Situational diagnosis
* Expectations
* Resources
* Style of communication w/boss
	* What modes of communication
	* Work hours
	* What can I decide alone/what do they need input
	* Data vs. conversations
	* Micromanage?
	* It's all on you to have a good boss relationship
* Personal development — what should my priorities be (once I'm settled in)?

A good solution to differences w/boss is to focus on goals and results, not methods

What metrics should you share to let boss know progress is being made

First 30 days: learn
	End of this time: have a diagnosis of the situation and an identification of key priorities and a plan for how to spend the next 30 days
	
First 60 days: review
	Assess progress towards existing plan
	Set goals for next 30 days

Set early wins
		Do them in waves
			Each wave -> consolidate -> learn -> next wave
			First wave: early wins
				Personal credibility
				Key relationships
				Low-hanging fruit
					But don't get too focused on low-hanging fruit
					You can miss business objectives
				Build a foundation
					Focus on few promising opportunities
					Get wins that matter to your boss
					Get wins in the right ways — don't be inconsistent w/the culture or underhanded
					Focus on STARS portfolio
					Make sure the culture sees it as a win
			Second wave:
				strategy, structure, systems, skills
				MUST follow first win
Build Credibility
"Your credibility, or lack of it, will depend on how people would answer the following questions about you: Do you have the insight and steadiness to make tough decisions? Do you have values that they relate to, admire, and want to emulate? Do you have the right kind of energy? Do you demand high levels of performance from yourself and others?" (p. 105)
	Be demanding but able to be satisfied
	Be accessible but not too familiar 
	Be decisive but don't jump to conclusions/decisions
	Be focused but flexible
	Don't overwhelm/cause burnout
	Make the tough calls but be humane/fair
	Remove minor irritants
	Learn about the org
	Elevate change agents
Use the Early Wins Tool Table 5-2 p108
Use the FOGLAMP tool Table 5-3 p.109
Use the diagnostic framework Fig 5-2 p.112 I like this a lot
Learn collectively, don't always impose
	Try and get out of information silos

Don't
	Make changes for change's sake
	Ignore the STARS situation
	Change structures when the problem isn't the structure
	Create complex structure
	Move too fast/make too big change
	
"Your goal during your first 90 days should be to identify potential misalignments and design a plan for correcting them."(p. 120). 
	Between strategic direction & skill
	Between strategic direction & processes
	Between structure and processes
	Between structure and skills
	
Make a process map

Common traps
	Criticizing previous leadership
	Keeping the existing team too long
	Not keeping good people
	Adding new members to the team before you have the core
	Not keeping some stability
	Not making sure team development and org alignment happen in parallel
	Making decisions before you have your core team
	Trying to do it all yourself
	
How to judge the people
	Competence
	Judgement
		How to find out: ask about things they are passionate about; push them to commit themselves
	Energy
	Focus
	Relationships (do they get along with others)
	Trust

What to do with the people
	Keep in place
	Keep and develop
	Move to another position
	Replace (low priority)
	Replace (high priority)
	Jury's out
	
	Push and pull
		Push = goals, measurements, incentives — use loyalty, fear, reward
		Pull = vision - use future
	Design an incentive system that helps directs act as agents for you
		And the stories and metaphors to communicate it
		
Are meetings too inclusive or too exclusive?

How to decide?
	Consult-and-decide 
		if it's a divisive decision (and then take heat)
		If team members are inexperienced
	Build Consensus
		If requires support from others I can't control
		If you don't have established authority

Virtual Teams
	Bring the team together early
	Establish communication norms
	Define team support roles
	Create a rhythm for team interactions
	Celebrate success
			
Influence
	Build up a good bank of credibility
	Have boss connect to key stakeholders
	Find supporters
		People who share your vision
		People who have been working for change
		People new to the company
		Nurture them
	Identify opposition (and why)
		Comfort with the status quo
		Fear of looking incompetent
		Threats to core values
		Threats to their power
		Negative consequences for allies
		Don't assume they're implacable
	Persuadables
		Indifferent, you can trade them support
		Undecided — but why?
		Political operators — convince them the wind is blowing your way
		
	Understand motivations
		It's mostly situational pressures
		How do they perceive alternatives/choices?
		Consult
		Frame your arguments on a person-by-person basis
		Shape choices so yours is the most reasonable
		Aim for public support
		Sequence the people you get on your side to build momentum
		Have action-forcing events to prevent deferring decisions
			Meetings
			deadlines
			Anything that expects follow-through
			
Understand yourself
	Guidelines for Structured Reflection p.178
	What are my problems?
		Undefended boundaries
		Brittleness/defensiveness
		Isolation
		Avoidance (putting stuff off just makes it worse)
		Burnout
Manage yourself
	Devote time daily and weekly to self-planning
	Focus on the important work, not the urgent
	Never say yes on the spot if you can avoid it
	Get out of the weeds when emotion is high
	Reflect on my day every day, to see how I'm behaving/if I could do better/worse
	Don't burn yourself out
	Get your office set up
	Make sure you have advisors
		Insiders and outsiders
